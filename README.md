# BrowserSelector

## What's this?

[BrowserSelctor](https://gitlab.com/clear-code/browserselector) is a
web-browser launcher for Microsoft Windows that aims to select an appropriate
browser for an URL. Since many tranditional intranet web applications still
depend on Internet Explorer, so such enterprise users need to switch IE and
modern web-browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) according to
the situation. This application will do it automatically on clicking or
entering an URL.

This software consists of two modules:

  * BrowserSelector.exe:
    The web-browser launcher. Should be set as the default web-browser on
    your desktop.
  * BrowserSelectorBHO.dll:
    A BHO (Browser Helper Object) for IE. It will launch Mozilla Firefox
    or Google Chrome to open internet sites.

This software doesn't support switching from other browsers to IE. Please use
with appropriate extensions for them to do it.
If you use Mozilla Firefox as a second browser, we recommend to use them with
IE View WE to launch IE from Firefox to open intranet sites.

  * IE View WE: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ie-view-we/

The equivalent for Google Chrome is IE Tab.

  * IE Tab: https://www.ietab.net/

## How to Build

  * Open BrowserSelector.sln by Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (or later)
  * Select "Release" (or "Debug") from the toolbar
  * Press F7 key

## How to Install

Run built BrowserSelectorSetup\Release\BrowserSelectorSetup.msi.

## Change the Default Browser

If you want to switch web browsers automatically from all applications, you
need to set BrowserSelector.exe as the default browser on your desktop.
How to do it is depend on your OS and situation. For example:

  * https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028606/windows-10-change-your-default-browser
  * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/set-the-default-browser-using-group-policy

If you use only the BHO and don't use BrowserSelector.exe, it's not needed.

## How to Configure

This software doesn't have any UI. System administrators have to edit its
registry entries directly and shouldn't allow users to edit them.

If you build 32bit binary of BrowserSelector (it's the default), the registry
key is:

* `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` or `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`
  * for 64bit OS: `SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\ClearCode\BrowserSelector`
  * for 32bit OS: `SOFTWARE\ClearCode\BrowserSelector`

If a same named value exists in both `HKLM` adn `HKCU`, they will be merged
(overridden by `HKCU`'s one).

Please see the following *.reg files by way of example:

  * [For 64bit OS](sample/BrowserSelectorWOW64Example.reg)
  * [For 32bit OS](sample/BrowserSelectorExample.reg)

## Config items

### `HostNamePatterns` or `URLPatterns`

#### Simple Pattern Matching

You need to set hostname or URL patterns to open them by specific browsers.
They are stored under the registry key `HostNamePatterns` and `URLPatterns` as
string values. Although you can use any characters as the value names, we
recommend to use numbers such as `0001` to clarify the priority. The value is
hostname or URL pattern. Optionally you can add a browser name to open the URL
pattern by spliting the value by `|`.

e.g.)

  * `HostNamePatterns`
    * `0001` = `*.example.org|firefox`
  * URLPatterns
    * `0001` = `http://*.example.com|firefox`

The following wildcard characters are supported for specifying host names or
URLs:

  * `*`: matches any string
  * `?`: matches any single character

For browser names, following values are supported:

  * `ie`
  * `firefox`
  * `chrome`

When the browser name is unspecified, `DefaultBrowser` or `SecondBrowser` will
be used as described later.

#### Regular Expression

You can use also regular expression for hostname or URL patterns when you set
the following registry value under the top of `BrowserSelector` key:

  * `"UseRegex"` = `dword:00000001`

Please see the following page for the grammer of the regular expression:

  https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript

A browser names can be added in this case too. Please add a browser name after
`$` assersion like this:

  * `0001` = `^http(s)?://(.+\\.)?example\\.(org|com)(/.*)?$firefox`

### `DefaultBrowser`

You can change the browser for opening unmatched URLs by setting the registry
value `DefaultBrowser` under the top of `BrowserSelector` key.

e.g)

  * `DefaultBrowser` = `firefox`

The default value of `DefaultBrowser` is `ie`.

### `SecondBrowser`

If you leave the browser name empty for each URL patterns, the browser
specified by `DefaultBrowser` will be used for them. If you want to change the
browser for such URL patterns, you can do it by the registry value
`SecondBrowser` under the top of `BrowserSelector` key.

e.g.)

  * `URLPagtterns`
    * `0001` = `http://*.example.com`
    * `0002` = `http://*.example.org`
    * ...
  * `SecondBrowser` = `chrome`

The default value of `SecondBrowser` is empty (use `DefaultBrowser`).
