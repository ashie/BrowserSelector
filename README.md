# BrowserSelector

## What's this?

This is a web-browser launcher application for Microsoft Windows that aims to
select an appropriate browser for an URL. Since many tranditional intranet web
applications still depend on Internet Explorer, such enterprise users need to
switch IE and modern web-browsers such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome
according to the situation. This application will do it automatically on
clicking or entering an URL. Currently only Firefox is supported as the second
browser.

This software consists of two modules:

  * BrowserSelector.exe:
    The web-browser launcher. Should be set as the default web-browser on
    your desktop.
  * BrowserSelectorBHO.dll:
    A BHO (Browser Helper Object) for IE. It will launch Firefox to open
    internet sites.

In addition, we recommend to use them with the Firefox's add-on
[IE View WE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ie-view-we/) to
launch IE from Firefox to open intranet sites.

## How to Build

  * Open BrowserSelector.sln by Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (or later)
  * Select "Release" (or "Debug") from the toolbar
  * Press F7 key

## How to Install

## How to Configure

This software doesn't have any UI. System administrators should edit its
registry entries directly and shouldn't allow users to edit them.

### FQDN or URL patterns

You need to set FQDN or URL patterns of you intranet to open them by IE.
The patterns are stored in the registry of Windows.

Please see the following examples for more detail:

  * [For 32bit OS](sample/BrowserSelectorExample.reg)
  * [For 64bit OS](sample/BrowserSelectorWOW64Example.reg)

The following wildcard characters are supported for specifying FQDN or URL:

  * `*`: matches any string
  * `?`: matches any single character

### Default Web Browser

You need to set BrowserSelector as your default browser. The way to do it is
depends on your version of Windows.
