TODO
----

* Make the absolute path for IE (`IE_PATH`) configurable.
* Create a XPI package and get it registered on mozilla.org.
* Support Google Chrome
* Support Microsoft Edge
* Implement "Config" command to pass configurations to addons.
* Confirm that the call for CreateProcess() is not insecure.
